# The Bitcoin Token Website.

BitcoinToken is a toolkit for building blockchain enabled applications on top of Bitcoin Cash. It consists of three tools: a wallet, a database built on the blockchain, and a token solution. These are meant to be combined by the developer to adapt to the desired application. The code is written in Javascript and runs in the browser and in node.
